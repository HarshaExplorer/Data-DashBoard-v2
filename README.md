# *Geographic Dashboard*

Created by: **Harshavardan Yuvaraj**

*This dynamic web dashboard seamlessly fetches comprehensive geographical data from Ninja's Country API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/country). The application offers robust filtering capabilities and presents users with interactive bar charts (built using Recharts), enabling a nuanced exploration of the population vs. unemployment relationship. Additionally, the dashboard includes a feature where clicking on a country navigates the user to a dedicated page, providing more in-depth statistics for the selected country. This enhances the user experience, offering a unique perspective on geographic data trends.*
